Audio Processing System Setup Guide
================================

This system consists of two components: a server and a client that need to run simultaneously.

Server Setup
-----------
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory:
   cd server

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   # Create venv IF there isn't one
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate venv (choose based on your shell):
   # For Git Bash on Windows:
   source .venv/Scripts/activate
   # For Windows CMD:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the server:
   python server.py


Client Setup
-----------
1. Open a NEW terminal and navigate to the client directory:
   cd client

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   # Create venv IF there isn't one
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate venv (choose based on your shell):
   # For Git Bash on Windows:
   source .venv/Scripts/activate
   # For Windows CMD:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the client:
   python audio_ws.py
   # Or for 500ms version:
   python audio_ws_500ms.py

Important Notes
-------------
- The server must be started before running the client
- Both components must run simultaneously in separate terminals
- Make sure ffmpeg.exe (in client/bin) is accessible
- Each component has its own virtual environment and requirements
- Audio files (.ogg, .wav) are gitignored to keep the repository clean
