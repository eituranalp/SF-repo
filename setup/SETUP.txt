1. Create a .env file in the project root with your API key:
   
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
   AUDIO_DEBUG=false
   AUDIO_CHUNK_MS=200

Server Setup
-----------
1. Navigate to the audio directory:
   cd audio

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # For Git Bash on Windows:
